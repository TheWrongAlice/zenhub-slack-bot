## Installation

### Creating the Slack app
The easiest way is to create a configuration of Slack's own _Bots_ app.<br />
Go to https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots and click "Add Configuration" to get started.

### Setting up the bot application
_We'll assume that you are familiar with node.js. Otherwise there are tons of guides online._

Before we can get started, you need to set some environment variables.
```
export GITHUB_USER=TheWrongAlice           # Name of your Github user
export GITHUB_REPO_NAME=zenhub-slack-bot   # Name of your Github repository
export GITHUB_REPO_ID=123940607            # ID of your Github repository
export GITHUB_TOKEN=yourtoken123           # Auth token for your Github account/repo
export ZENHUB_TOKEN=yourtoken123           # Auth token for your Zenhub account
export SLACK_TOKEN=yourtoken123            # Auth token for your Slack bot
```

Install some node dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run server
```
npm start
```

## Usage

Add the bot to any channel, or include it in your direct message conversations.<br />
The bot will recognize issues by any these formats:
```
#123
issue-123
issues/123
https://github.com/TheWrongAlice/zenhub-slack-bot/issues/123
https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/thewrongalice/zenhub-slack-bot/issues/123
